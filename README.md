# UX Rockstar Layout Module

Out of the four modules of the National World Skills UK Competition held in 2019 in Birmingham, the second module required competitors to recreate a responsive website using HTML5 and CSS3 from just a screenshot to the finest detail they possibly could. We were given a screenshot of what the final website must look like, a document with detailed instructions including hex colour codes, fonts and hover effects, plus any raw images and text content. We had only 3 hours to complete this task.

This module was designed to test our HTML5 and CSS3 knowledge and our ability to work under pressure.

We were marked on 4 different criteria -

- W3C Validation (HTML5 & CSS3) and Semantics
- Likeness to design provided
- Code Structure
- Folder Structure & Button Design
